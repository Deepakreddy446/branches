    <p>
      *Visual Studio is an integrated development environment (IDE) developed by
      Microsoft.<br />
      *It is used to develop computer programs including websites, web apps, web
      services and mobile apps.<br />
      *Visual Studio uses Microsoft software development platforms including
      Windows API, Windows Forms, Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF),
      Microsoft Store and Microsoft Silverlight.<br />
      *It can produce both native code and managed code. Visual Studio includes
      a code editor supporting IntelliSense (the code completion component) as
      well as code refactoring. <br />*The integrated debugger works as both a
      source-level debugger and as a machine-level debugger. <br />*Other
      built-in tools include a code profiler, designer for building GUI
      applications, web designer, class designer, and database schema
      designer.<br />
    </p>
    <h2>features</h2>
    <p>
      *Code Editing: VS Code provides syntax highlighting, autocompletion, and
      code formatting for a variety of programming languages, making it easy for
      developers to write and edit code <br />*Integrated Terminal: VS Code
      comes with an integrated terminal, allowing developers to execute commands
      and run scripts without having to leave the editor<br />
      *Git Integration: VS Code has built-in support for Git, allowing
      developers to easily manage source code changes and collaborate with other
      developers.
      <br />
      *Debugging: VS Code has a powerful debugger that supports multiple
      languages and allows developers to set breakpoints, step through code, and
      examine variables.
      <br />
      *Extensions: VS Code has a rich ecosystem of extensions that provide
      additional functionality and support for specific programming languages,
      frameworks, and tools.
      <br />
      *IntelliSense: VS Code provides intelligent code completion, code
      suggestions, and parameter hints for a wide range of languages and
      frameworks, making it easier for developers to write code quickly and
      accurately.
      <br />
      *Live Share: VS Code has a live share feature that allows developers to
      collaborate in real time on the same codebase, regardless of their
      location.
      <br />
      *Task Runner: VS Code has a built-in task runner that allows developers to
      automate common tasks, such as building, testing, and deploying code.
